**ANALYSIS AND CLASSIFICATION OF CAPITAL ASSISTANCE RECIPIENTS FROM KEDIRI TRADE AND INDUSTRY DEPARTMENT USING RANDOM FOREST**



**ABSTRAK**

Capital assistance provided by the Kediri City Department of Trade and Industry often faces challenges related to the uncertainty of fund distribution, making it difficult to ensure the effectiveness of the assistance itself in improving business revenue. To address this, a prediction-based model is applied to evaluate the factors influencing the success of capital assistance in increasing recipientsâ€™ income. This study aims to classify recipients based on business revenue outcomes using the Random Forest algorithm. Furthermore, the model identifies key factors affecting the success of assistance and offers recommendations for optimizing future distribution through feature importance analysis. The results demonstrate that the Random Forest model achieves an accuracy of 75%, highlighting its potential as a reliable tool for predicting the success of capital assistance. The feature importance analysis further reveals that training contributes 49% and business type 43%, emphasizing their crucial role in enhancing the effectiveness of future assistance programs.




**CONCLUSION**

Data exploration revealed patterns in the distribution and allocation of financial aid to MSME recipients in Kediri City. The Random Forest model successfully identified key factors influencing the success of capital assistance, with training emerging as the most important feature (49% importance). Within training, marketing-focused programs (35%) were particularly critical, especially for food sector businesses, which demonstrated higher potential to increase revenue (43%). Infrastructure support also contributed to improved business outcomes by enhancing product presentation. These findings provide actionable insights for policymakers: future capital assistance programs should prioritize targeted training, consider sector-specific interventions, and ensure adequate infrastructure support to maximize the effectiveness of fund distribution and enhance recipient business success.
